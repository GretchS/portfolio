        <figure><p>RUBY</p>
          <p>Whilst in the process of learning the art of programming, we developed terminal apps in small groups.</p>
          <p>My team embarked on ‘Project Kangaroo’, an app designed to help with decision making. </p>
          <p>People are notoriously bad at decision making, and group decision making compounds the difficulty, so our app was an attempt at reducing the difficulty of this process.</p>
          <p> Imagine being able to decide on a restaurant for dinner with a group of friends in just a couple of minutes…. Imagine being able to choose what city you should move two after just a few keyboard entries…. Imagine having an unbiased voting system that allowed you to choose the name of your child with no stress…</p>
          <p>The Project Kangaroo app allowed people to enter multiple options, and then had users vote for their preferred options; or, if they were game, to allow the app to randomly generate a preferred option.</p>
          <p>It was a great learning experience that we had fun with.</p></figure>

            <p>CSS</p>
            <P>As well as designing a portfolio website, I have had the pleasure of creating a diamond in CSS. Who knew triangles could be so ambiguous? </P></figure>
