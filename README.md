# Personal Portfolio

# Aim

Previously I designed a personal portfolio site for a course, this is the tidied up version of that initial site. My aim is to create a clean, concise portfolio page that shows my personality (heaven forbid) and a liking for art and design.

Usability heuristics were considered at each part of the process, so all pages are laid out in a similar manner with the menu bar and naming conventions staying the same.

All colours, fonts and wording style are consistently maintained throughout the site.

## About

Since the portfolio is designed to be a representation of who I am, the language used is relatively informal. This is consistent throughout the site.
