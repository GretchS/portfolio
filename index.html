      <p>I’m sure you’ve heard this all before
      Sure you look familiar, sure the cost of living
      Keep on rising with no limits
      N-Name a politician gave a fuck about your feelings
      Name a single trend that didn’t end up like a gimmick
      Think there’s something in the water
      Tell me what the mission is, I see lead showers
      Code word. Flint Michigan
      Attire match my melanin
      Black on Black is militant
      Represents my diligence
      I see through that privilege</p>
      <p>And I still don’t watch the news
      Barely trust the facts now
      Liar liar liar, throwing stones
      Then hide hands. Wow
      That don’t make no man proud
      Tears might make my city drown
      I’m too scared to speak to God
      There’s shooters in the churches now
      Somethings in the water
      Tell me what the mission is
      Just another citizen that sacrifice my discipline
      Still don’t know my origin
      Still don’t know who’s listening
      Still can’t tell the difference between
      Strength and my conditioning</p>
